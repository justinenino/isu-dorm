# Database Column Fix Guide - submitted_at Error

## 🚨 **Error Identified**

**Error:** `Database error: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'mr.submitted_at' in 'ORDER BY'`

**Root Cause:** The application code was trying to use `submitted_at` column in the `maintenance_requests` and `complaints` tables, but these tables only have `created_at` column.

## 🔍 **Analysis**

### What's Happening:
1. The code references `mr.submitted_at` in ORDER BY clauses
2. The database schema uses `created_at` instead of `submitted_at`
3. This causes "Column not found" errors when trying to sort results
4. Both maintenance_requests and complaints tables are affected

### Files Affected:
- `admin/maintenance_requests.php` - Lines 74, 93, 325, 814
- `admin/complaints_management.php` - Line 185, 280, 453

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### 1. **Fixed Code References**
- ✅ Changed `mr.submitted_at` to `mr.created_at` in maintenance_requests.php
- ✅ Changed `c.submitted_at` to `c.created_at` in complaints_management.php
- ✅ Updated all ORDER BY clauses to use correct column names
- ✅ Fixed all SELECT queries to reference existing columns

### 2. **Created Fix Script**
- ✅ `fix_submitted_at_column.php` - Comprehensive testing and validation script
- ✅ Tests database queries to ensure they work
- ✅ Validates that the fix is working correctly

### 3. **Database Schema Verification**
- ✅ Confirmed maintenance_requests table has `created_at` column
- ✅ Confirmed complaints table has `created_at` column
- ✅ No `submitted_at` columns exist in the schema

## 🚀 **How to Fix on Hostinger**

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Files (Recommended)
1. Upload the updated files to your Hostinger account:
   - `admin/maintenance_requests.php`
   - `admin/complaints_management.php`
2. The fix is already applied in the code
3. No database changes needed

### Option 2: Run the Fix Script
1. Upload `fix_submitted_at_column.php` to your Hostinger account
2. Visit: `https://yourdomain.com/fix_submitted_at_column.php`
3. The script will test and validate the fix
4. Delete the script after running

## 📋 **What Was Changed**

### In `admin/maintenance_requests.php`:
```sql
-- Before (causing error):
ORDER BY mr.submitted_at DESC

-- After (fixed):
ORDER BY mr.created_at DESC
```

### In `admin/complaints_management.php`:
```sql
-- Before (causing error):
ORDER BY c.submitted_at DESC

-- After (fixed):
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC
```

## 🔧 **Database Schema Reference**

### maintenance_requests table columns:
- `id` - Primary key
- `student_id` - Foreign key to students
- `room_id` - Foreign key to rooms
- `title` - Request title
- `description` - Request description
- `priority` - Request priority
- `status` - Request status
- `assigned_to` - Admin assigned to handle
- `admin_notes` - Admin notes
- `created_at` - **Timestamp when created** ✅
- `updated_at` - Timestamp when last updated
- `completed_at` - Timestamp when completed

### complaints table columns:
- `id` - Primary key
- `student_id` - Foreign key to students
- `subject` - Complaint subject
- `description` - Complaint description
- `status` - Complaint status
- `priority` - Complaint priority
- `assigned_to` - Admin assigned to handle
- `admin_response` - Admin response
- `created_at` - **Timestamp when created** ✅
- `updated_at` - Timestamp when last updated
- `resolved_at` - Timestamp when resolved

## ✅ **Expected Results**

After applying the fix:
- ✅ Maintenance requests page loads without errors
- ✅ Complaints management page loads without errors
- ✅ Data is sorted by creation date correctly
- ✅ No more "Column not found: submitted_at" errors
- ✅ All timestamps display properly

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

### Test 1: Check Maintenance Requests
1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Click on "Maintenance Requests"
3. Verify the page loads without errors
4. Check that requests are sorted by date

### Test 2: Check Complaints Management
1. Go to admin dashboard
2. Click on "Complaints Management"
3. Verify the page loads without errors
4. Check that complaints are sorted by date

### Test 3: Check Database Queries
Run this query in phpMyAdmin to test:
```sql
SELECT mr.*, s.first_name, s.last_name, r.room_number
FROM maintenance_requests mr
LEFT JOIN students s ON mr.student_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN rooms r ON mr.room_id = r.id
ORDER BY mr.created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### Why This Happened:
- The code was written expecting `submitted_at` columns
- The database schema uses `created_at` instead
- This is a common naming convention mismatch

### Why `created_at` is Better:
- `created_at` is a standard naming convention
- It's more descriptive of what the timestamp represents
- It's consistent with other tables in the system
- It follows Laravel/PHP best practices

### No Data Loss:
- No data was lost in this fix
- Only column references were changed
- All existing records remain intact
- Timestamps are preserved

## 📁 **Files Modified**

### Modified Files:
- `admin/maintenance_requests.php` - Fixed all submitted_at references
- `admin/complaints_management.php` - Fixed all submitted_at references

### New Files:
- `fix_submitted_at_column.php` - Testing and validation script
- `SUBMITTED_AT_COLUMN_FIX_GUIDE.md` - This guide

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Deploy the fixed files** to Hostinger
2. **Test the maintenance requests page** to ensure it loads
3. **Test the complaints management page** to ensure it loads
4. **Verify data sorting** works correctly
5. **Delete the fix script** after confirming everything works

The "Column not found: submitted_at" error should now be completely resolved! 🎉
