# PDF Attachment Fix - Deployment Package

## 📋 What This Package Fixes
- Resolves "Page Not Found" error when viewing PDF attachments in reservation management
- Creates missing uploads directory structure
- Adds security measures for file uploads
- Enhances error handling for missing files

## 📁 Files Included

### 1. Directory Structure
```
uploads/
├── .htaccess                    # Security file to prevent execution
└── student_documents/
    └── test_document.pdf        # Sample PDF file
```

### 2. Modified Files
```
admin/
└── get_student_details.php      # Enhanced with file existence checking
```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Upload Files
1. Upload the entire `uploads/` folder to your project root
2. Upload `admin/get_student_details.php` to replace the existing file

### Step 2: Set Permissions
- Ensure `uploads/` directory has write permissions (755 or 777)
- Ensure `uploads/student_documents/` directory has write permissions

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Go to Admin Panel → Reservation Management
2. Click "View" on any student
3. Check if PDF attachments work properly

## 🔧 What Changed

### Before:
- PDF links showed "Page Not Found" error
- Missing uploads directory structure
- No file existence checking

### After:
- PDF links work properly if files exist
- Clear error messages if files are missing
- Secure file upload directory
- Proper path handling

## 📝 Notes
- Existing students with PDF references in database will show "File Not Found" until actual PDF files are uploaded
- The `.htaccess` file prevents execution of malicious files in uploads directory
- Test PDF file is included for testing purposes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting
If you still see "Page Not Found":
1. Check if `uploads/student_documents/` directory exists
2. Verify file permissions are set correctly
3. Check if the PDF file actually exists at the expected path
4. Clear browser cache and try again
